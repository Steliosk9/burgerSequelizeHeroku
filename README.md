# Sequelized Burger Application

![](images/burgerSnap.PNG)

## Getting Started

Created a Sequelized Burger app. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.<br>
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.<br>
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.<br>
My app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
